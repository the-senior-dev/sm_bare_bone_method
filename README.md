# Action Item: The Bare Bone Method

In this Action Item you will: 
- 🧱 Use the `Bare Bone Method` to 10X your development speed in the frontend
- 🏗️ Practice `state architecture` in the front-end by working with local and global state
- 🧪 Write `component` and `end-2end` tests to ensure quality

We provide the starting code for this app so you can jump straight into the action. The following three challenges are based on **REAL interview tasks**:

## Challenges:
1. 💪[COMPETENT] Extend the `MainPage` to contain a view of the `Now Playing` movies
2. 🏋🏽‍♀️[PROFICIENT] Add a `Search` and a `Pagination` to the MainPage
3. 🔥[EXPERT] Add a `dark/light` switch to the whole app

**📌 [Click here to see the final result LIVE](https://bare-bone-final.netlify.app/) **

### Getting Started
1. You will need an API Key to make the requests to the API. You can get one [here](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction)
2. Check the `package.json` to see the scripts available. 
   1. Run `npm start` to run the app
   2. Run `npm test` to run the unit tests
   3. Run `npm run cy:open` to run the `e2e` tests
3. [The starting point looks like this](https://bare-bone-starting-point.netlify.app/)

### Recommendations
1. Use the [React Dev Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en) to inspect the component tree and data flow.
2. Draw your component breakdown using a tool like [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/).
3. Use the **State Architecture Cheat sheet** to decide where to place your state.

### 1. [COMPETENT] Extend the `MainPage` to contain a view of the `Upcoming` movies
![](examples/now-playing-low-fidelity.png)

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. The `MainPage` should display a section with the upcoming movies
2. The style should be the same as the [TrendingNow](src/components/TrendingNow.tsx) component - you can just copy that one.

Use the bare bone method to structure your component and data flow before styling. Check out how we do that here. [VIDEO WITH BARE BONE HERE]

###### Hint: you might need to extend the [movieApiClient] and add a method to fetch a list of the movies upcoming. Check out [the endpoint documentation here](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/movies/get-upcoming).

###### Hint: you can reuse the same component if you "lift state", extract the business logic and isolate the __rendering__ into a stateless component.

### 2. [COMPETENT] Add a `Search` and a `Pagination` to the MainPage

#### Acceptance Criteria
2.1. Add the missing parts and the functionality to the `SearchBar` component
- an input field where the users can type the `Movie` they want to search for
- a button that when pressed will cause a refetch of the movies that matched the search

2.2. Add a `Pagination` for the list of movies:
- the `pagination` should have a first, next, previous and last `button`
- clicking on the buttons should cause a refetch of the right movie page

###### Hint: you might need to extend the [movieApiClient] to fetch a certain page of movie results. Check out [the endpoint documentation here](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/search/search-movies).

###### Hint: take time to understand where the pagination state should live. You might need to "lift the state" in order to keep your components clean.

### Solution: Task 1
1. Search Bar - Solution Code
2. Search Bar - Solution Video
3. Pagination - Solution Code
4. Pagination - Solution Video

### 3. [EXPERT] Add a global language switch to the page
#### Acceptance Criteria
1. In the `Header`, add a dropdown that will change the theme of the whole website
2. All the component should switch color to match the dark/light mode
3. The theme choice should be persisted in `localStorage` 

> Light-on-dark color scheme —also called black mode, dark mode, dark theme, night mode, or lights-out (mode)— is a color scheme that uses light-colored text, icons, and graphical user interface elements on a dark background. -- Wikipedia

![dark-mode-switch](examples/dark-mode-switch.png)

#### Optional Acceptance Criteria:
- the language switch should pickup the browser default language if not configured previously
- the api calls should fetch data in the user preferred language when possible

###### Hint: take time to understand where the state of the localization will live and how you will distribute it to all the component.

###### Hint: although we leave the choice up to you, we recommend a light-weight state management solution like React.Context.

### Solution
1. Code Solution - Language Switch
2. Video Solution - Language Switch

## Wrapping up

1. What are some improvement you would propose to the app?
2. Setup Git Hooks with Husky
3. Take the Action Item Assessment

### Getting Help

If you have issues with the Action Item, you can ask for help in the [Community](https://community.theseniordev.com/) or in the [Weekly Q&A’s](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=Y19kbGVoajU1Z2prNXZmYmdoYmxtdDRvN3JyNEBncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t).
